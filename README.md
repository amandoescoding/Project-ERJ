<h3>Overview:</h3>

This is an Embraer ERJ135 made entirely from scratch for the X Plane community, with one of the aims that this aircraft being a high quality freeware aircraft. The model will include a deatiled interior and exterior. The cockpit will be modelled with full detail but will not be study level, so expect a few small changes in desgn and visuals. The ERj will also include a sliding door rather than the traditional pull down doors with foldable stairs attached. 

<h3>Updates:</h3>

As of August 2022, the plane has been almost completed:

<ol>
<li>The Cabin has been modelled with the modelling detail to the best where possible, a lot has been reworked.</li>
<li>The Wings, Gears, Exterior Fueslage has been completed with no further rework.</li>
<li>Texturing has been done through a trial and error period allowing texturing to be done at its best.</li>
<li>The datarefs. manipulators and a new paintkit (in development) is in the works by the developers mentioned below.</li>
</ol>
